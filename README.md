This repository currently contains two files:

1) GauranteedDeath2.pdf  - A Latex generated file that shows that the Noxious Fumes Card will kill a monster with h health points in ceil((-3 + sqrt(8 * 100 + 9)) / 2) turns.
2) NoxiousFumesCertainDeath.pdf - A copy of the same information formatted as a blog post.  (Copied from artent.net - an old fashion insecure http blog.)
3) GauranteedDeathByNoxFumPlus.pdf - A Latex generated file that claims that the Noxious Fumes Card+ will kill a monster with h health points in sqrt(h) turns.  No proofs provided.
